<h1>Someday, I will make something that truly matters.</br>Until then, just call me Delton.</h1>
<p>I am a twenty-something game artist with an inordinate amount of drive to succeed, the talent to make it happen, and just enough confidence to make this whole sentence feel like an achievable goal.  I've been playing games for about half as long as I've been reading fantasy novels, and making them for two years.  I'm no slouch with a pen, either-I've successfully participated in National Novel Writing Month, and have written a few scripts, a short screenplay, and innumerable essays.  I'm an actor and a singer, but that doesn't matter to you.  I've dabbled in music and programming, too.  But that doesn't matter to you.</p>
