<p style="clear:both;">I had a lot of fun with this game.  I got to do some voice acting, which was a lot of fun, and I got to really get into character design.  I decided early on that I wanted to play with as many resources as I could and create a character that had dimensionality and personality.  In order to do that, I used ZBrush to polish the character model and create normal maps, and I made sure to optimize his polygon count and flow for use in games.
