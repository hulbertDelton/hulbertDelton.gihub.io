<p>Enough is a small VR project about player agency and choice. In my academic career, it came up a lot, and people seemed to resign themselves to the idea that games are games, and there are some things you, as the designer, have to do to keep the plot moving forward, and it can't be helped. This is an examination of that. You enter the scene with no context, and you must leave it without context, too.</p>

<p style="clear:both;">This was an opportunity for me to push myself to produce the highest quality PBR textures while still having a VR-playable experience, and it was a lot of fun. I also wanted to play with facial rigging and dynamic textures, but I haven't gotten there yet. Updates soon!
