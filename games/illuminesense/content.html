<p style="clear:both;">Global Game Jam was a blast this year.  I worked with a few people I have never worked with before and a few I have.  We were all friends by the end of the sprint, and though we were dead tired, we were proud and excited to show it off at the showcase at the end.  I think it came out really well, despite the fact that there are a few bugs that prevent it from really shining.  The team has expressed interest in pursuing the project, and we have some really cool ideas that could take this game from a pretty cut-and-dry wave defense game to something truly original.
