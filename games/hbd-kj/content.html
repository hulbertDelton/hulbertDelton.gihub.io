<p>Happy Birthday, Kai-Junior! is an action-puzzle game in which you control the egg of a nearly-hatched baby monster, or "kaiju", and destroy a city in an effort to crack your egg. We were graciously mentored by <a href="http://ichiro.us/">Ichiro Lambe</a> of Dejobaan Games.

<p style="clear:both;">Kayy Birthday, Kai-Junior was the first game I worked on where I was working for 40 hours per week in a shared office space with the rest of the team. For the first two months, I was the art director and the only animator, so I spent the majority of my time working with the art team to develop a visual language and get assets into production. After that, I took over as project lead and Producer, and the majority of my duties were administrative. I learned so much from the time I spent on this project, and from Ichiro. While the game was never finished, I am proud of the work I did on it, and I am glad to have the wealth of experience I gained from it.
