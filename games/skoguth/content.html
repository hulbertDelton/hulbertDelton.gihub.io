<p>Skoguth is a small interactive experience that asks, in not-so-subtle tones, what the illusion of choice in games really represents.  You are dropped into a forest with one bullet and one instruction: "Kill the god.  Be free."  What you do with that information is up to you, as long as it's within the restrictions the game places on you.  As the third member of the three-man team, I was late to the party, so my hand is only felt in the physical representation of the world.  I designed and built everything you see in it according to the specifications given me by the project's leader.

<p style="clear:both;">The game was really fun to work on.  It was the first thing I ever made that wasn't a Unity capsule jumping in space.  It felt real, and I felt powerful for having participated in its inception.  In hindsight, there are so many things that I'd have done differently, or better, but because it was only a month, I don't have any regrets.</p>
