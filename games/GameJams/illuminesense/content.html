<p>IllumineSense is a wave defense game in which you play a young child, Mako, who uses the power of sound, light, and water to fend off hordes of deceptively cute foes from the Great Crystal.  Done for Global Game Jam 2017.  There is a download link on the <a href = "http://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/illuminesense">GGJ 2017 page</a>.

<p style="clear:both;">Global Game Jam was a blast this year.  I worked with a few people I have never worked with before and a few I have.  We were all friends by the end of the sprint, and though we were dead tired, we were proud and excited to show it off at the showcase at the end.  I think it came out really well, despite the fact that there are a few bugs that prevent it from really shining.  The team has expressed interest in pursuing the project, and we have some really cool ideas that could take this game from a pretty cut-and-dry wave defense game to something truly original.
