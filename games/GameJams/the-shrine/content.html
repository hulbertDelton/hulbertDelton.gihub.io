<p>The Shrine is my team's entry for Global Game Jam 2016.  The theme was "ritual", so we made this game about an older security guard who has a... thing for the office manager, and collects his stuff for her shrine to him.  It's creepy and based off of a story one of the team members told me just before the game jam started.  Cold?  Maybe.  Funny?  Most definitely.  I did all the sound and music in the game with my mouth, and led the four artists to a very fun time.
