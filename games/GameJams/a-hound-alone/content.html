<p>A Hound, Alone is a point-and-click murder/mystery set in an animal kingdom version of 1940s film noir. You play Felix Felix, a hard-boiled cat detective who doesn't play by the rules. His partner Louie, a by-the-book rookie who's still wet behind the ears, tags along and provides insight and hints. Solve the murder of Daisy Muttson, an old police dog who got caught up in some bad business and ended up biting her own tail...

<p style="clear:both;">The goal here was to wind down from a semester of working on Happy Birthday, Kai-Junior with a low-stress game jam. We picked roles out of hats, and it ended up that I was an engineer, and the engineer on Kai-Junior was our 3D artist. We helped each other out a lot, but I actually ended up doing a lot of stuff on my own. It was tons of fun, and I think it looks great. It is far from finished, but I might end up cleaning some things up for the rest of the team soon.
