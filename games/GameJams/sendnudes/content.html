<p>This game was made on a whim one Friday to blow off steam. It is an audio-controlled shoot-em-up that quits itself when you win. <a href="https://luisvalle.itch.io/sonic-energy-navigation-to-defend-nurture-and-unite-distant-extraterrestrial-species">You can download it here</a>, though I may encourage you to... not... do that.

<p style="clear:both;">I haven't screamed so loudly or laughed so hard before or since the development of this game. It's in my portfolio becuase it brings me joy, not because I think it's a particularly ingenious or well-crafted game.
