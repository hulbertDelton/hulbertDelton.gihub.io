<p>Eugene Extreme is a small-scale platformer about finding yourself.  You play Eugene, a knock-off GI Joe owned by a child who doesn't take great care of his toys.  You come to life when he's not around, though, and in a fit of flexing and aerobics, you fall off the top of the bookshelf.  When you hit the ground, your arms, a leg, and your precious jetpack go flying.  you must collect your missing body parts, each of which imparts a new ability unto our Extreme hero, enabling him to reach the end of his humble quest.

<p style="clear:both;">I had a lot of fun with this game.  I got to do some voice acting, which was a lot of fun, and I got to really get into character design.  I decided early on that I wanted to play with as many resources as I could and create a character that had dimensionality and personality.  In order to do that, I used ZBrush to polish the character model and create normal maps, and I made sure to optimize his polygon count and flow for use in games.
