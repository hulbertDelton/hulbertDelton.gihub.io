<p>QuietUs is a letter to my teenage self, and was intended to be a journey into the past of a troubled young person.  It was the first time I used C# to code a game, and the first time I did 2D animation at all.  Lots of the features that I had planned for the game never made it in, including all the voice acting I did for the script, as well as a simple choice-tracking system that would remember your decisions and adjust the plot accordingly.

<p style="clear:both;">This game represents a lot of things for me, not the least of which is an honest look at a part of my childhood that I don't often discuss.  The game isn't about me, or my life, but I pulled heavily from how I feel about it to create QuietUs.  I don't actually know what possessed me to think that making this thing was a good idea, but I forged ahead anyway.  Due to some significant setbacks, the game didn't come out quite how I would have liked, but I am proud of the work I was able to get done, given my breadth of knowledge, or lack there of.  The name is was toying with the idea that a depressed person's mind is rarely quiet and sometimes thinking about death in a very real, very sober way.  It is a both command and a description.  the game was intended to be played multiple times, and it would change in small ways each time, slowly becoming more or less warped, depending on the player's decisions.  The idea was to simulate how your memory works (or rather, how it doesn't work that well), but again.  Setbacks.
