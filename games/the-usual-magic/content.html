<p style="clear:both;">This was a fascinating project for a lot of reasons, both in the work I was doing and in the people I was doing it with.  I was effectively in charge of everyone, which was a lot of responsibility, and for that reason I feel a strong sense of ownership over this game.  That said, I did not have a hand in the art, and I only managed the tasks and personel issues from the art team.  I was the sole engineer on the team, and I think I did a pretty excellent job at it.
