<h1>The Usual Magic</h1>
<!--add game info in lines here -->
<p>I've identified as an artist for a while now.  It's what I'm good at, it's what I like, it's where I'd like to find myself years down the road.  And yet, for some reason, I keep finding myself in front of a text editor, wondering how quaternions work.  The Usual Magic represents the unknown for me in a lot of ways, but primarily because I am the lead programmer in the team.  I am too quick, at times, to volunteer myself to just go ahead and make that thing I need to finish off the level when I have bigger fish to fry, but there's a part of me that wants to be back in familiar waters.  That said, this project has been extremely cool for me to work on.  I'm developing for the HTC Vive, a platform that I've never worked with before, and nobody I know has ever worked with before.  I feel like an intrepid explorer, even though I spend a lot of time reading about how other people have blazed the trail I am on.
