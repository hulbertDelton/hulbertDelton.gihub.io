<h1>The Usual Magic</h1>

<p>I've identified as an artist for a while now.  It's what I'm good at, it's what I like, it's where I'd like to find myself years down the road.  And yet, for some reason, I keep finding myself in front of a text editor, wondering how quaternions work.  The Usual Magic represents the unknown for me in a lot of ways, but primarily because I am the lead programmer in the team.  During this project, I have been too quick, at times, to volunteer myself to just go ahead and make that 3D model I needed to finish off the level when I have bigger fish to fry, but there's a part of me that wants to be back in familiar waters, dreaming up what the game should look like.  That said, this project has been extremely cool for me to work on.  I'm developing for the HTC Vive, a platform that I've never worked with before, and nobody I know has ever worked with before.  I feel like an intrepid explorer, even though I spend a lot of time reading about how other people have blazed the trail I am on.  I'm the creative director- It's my vision coming to life once again, but this time in a whole new way, since I have complete control over the mechanical functionality of the game.  I expected that to be stifling, but it's been eye-opening.  Turns out programmers are jerks to people like me for no reason--they really do need me to rename my assets in the modeling software itself, not just the exported files.
