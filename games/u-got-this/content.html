<p>u got this is an endless runner which is neither endless, nor can you run.  You play a man with a crippling amphetamine addiction who lives, at least for now, in a hospital room.  The nurses are always behind schedule, but you've been here long enough to know where they keep the goods.  We collaborated with students from the Berklee School of Music in Boston, which was a tremendous experience in leadership and design.  The game was designed to function with an arcade cabinet as part of the project restrictions placed on us by the professor teaching the class.

<p style="clear:both;">This project started as a crass joke between my team members and I, and evolved alarmingly quickly into a very real thing.  The team fondly referred to this game as a "crutch runner" for a long time, and I still think of it that way.  If you ever think of it, ask me about why I made the choices I made for this game.  The Berklee students were a joy to work with, and I ended up friends with the both of them.
