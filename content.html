<p>Friender Bender has been Greenlit!  We're on Steam starting the 14th of January, and the team and I are working on adding another car and another track to the Steam release!  It's playable now on our <a href = "https://wickedly.itch.io/friender-bender">itch.io page</a>.

My Wacom tablet has ceased functioning, which has put a real damper on my ability to make stuff.  I'm hoping to get a new, improved tablet soon, but if you would <a href = "https://www.gofundme.com/deltonsArtAdventure">help me out</a>, I would be eternally grateful!  I've devised some cool rewards for people who donate above a certain threshhold.  Like Kickstarter.

<h1>Latest Updates</h1>
<p>I've been working on some very exciting stuff this winter, and as soon as it's public knowledge I'll tell you all about it, promise.  Until then, just know that it's an AR game with some amazing prospects and some very cool people and I feel way out of my league, which is exactly where I wanted to be at this point in my life.  I'm terrified but so inspired and I sound extroverted enough right now that I need to sign off and make some tea or something so goodbye.
