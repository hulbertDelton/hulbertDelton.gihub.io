<p>Friender Bender has been crazy fun to develop, and crazy fun to play, too.  Check out the progress on our <a href = "https://wickedly.itch.io/friender-bender">itch.io page</a>.

This is a moogle.  For those Final Fantasy fans, I hope that's pretty obvious (or else I have some real considerations to make).  I did this drawing for fun a while back, and when I was presented with the opportunity to make him into a 3D model for class credit, of course I jumped on it.  The ultimate goal here is to rig him and toss him into Unity.  For what, I don't know.  For fun, probably.

<p>Searching for internships has been a trip.  It is as close to searching for "real adult jobs" as I've ever gotten, and it's sort of surreal.  Not in a bad way, by any means, but certainly stressful.  I'll continue to do my best to get hired!
