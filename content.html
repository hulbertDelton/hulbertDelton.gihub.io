<p>Friender Bender has been Greenlit!  We're on Steam starting the 14th of January, and the team and I are working on adding another car and another track to the Steam release!  It's playable now on our <a href = "https://wickedly.itch.io/friender-bender">itch.io page</a>.

I've been busy working on a couple of things, one of which I can't really talk about.  The other, however, is my undergraduate capstone.  We're working with Dejobaan Games in Cambridge to make a game prototype!  The details are still being ironed out, but we do know it's a physics-based action game featuring a skateboarding kaiju.  Good times, great jokes.

<h1>Latest Updates</h1>
<p>Big Movement Games has been trying to get a foot in the door to start work on an incredible mobile game project, and I've been leading their 3D art team for about a month now.  It's overwhelmingly useful stuff I'm doing here, and I've never felt so empowered and important.  I hope you'll be as excited about this game as I am once things get rolling.
