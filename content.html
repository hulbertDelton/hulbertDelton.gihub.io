<p>I'm working on a personal project that I've been ruminating on for a long time. I don't want to spoil anything, but it could be interesting. It's a VR game that talks about the illusion of choice in games, violence in media, and player agency. Could be really bad, but I'm learning a ton, which is what it's all about. Character face rigging and animation, lighting, realistic modeling and textures, C#.  It's all in there.

<p>Hey, I did it! After a long undergraduate career, I'm finally finished with college. This is where it gets interesting... I'm also moving back to Boston, so I'll be attending more meetups and things. It's all very exciting.
