<h1><p>Recent Works</p></h1>
<p>Britt Snyder, the professor of my 3D Modeling 2 class, asked us to make a bust.  Just mat cap gray.  Just a face.  I've never really been good for "halfway", though, and when the face started to take form, I had to paint it.  I'm currently working on the body part, and I hope to have a full character before the end of the year.  With all my other work, it just might happen.

<h1>Latest Updates</h1>
<p>College is in full swing again, and I am taking on 6 classes, two of which are asking me to make a game in three months flat.  My art muscles are being flexed, with a 3D Modeling class and an independent study, and my programming chops are being worked in Computer Science 2 and Advanced Game Workshop.  I'm taking an independent study, as well, in which I and six others are making a (hopefully) complete game in a semester.  Check out progress on the <a href = "/games/friender-bender">Friender Bender</a> project page.
